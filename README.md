# zammad_installer
This little script aims to simplify and to automate as much as possible the whole Zammad installation process described here:
https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/install/centos.html

It has been tested to correctly work on CentOS 8 for now.
Other CentOS versions and distributions may come as long as I have the time to adapt my code.

## usage
First off, you must be root to run this tool.

Using this installer is pretty straight-forward:
1. clone this repo
2. cd zammad_installer
3. chmod +x ./zammad_installer.sh
4. ./zammad_installer.sh

And, please, be patient... it will take some time to install everything for you.
How much will depend on your server specifications and your network speed...
